Clearly, homozygous mutations associated with p.R401X cause a severe phenotype. However, the range of outcomes is variable, with some patients having an early demise and others living at least into their teenage years. Patients 2 and 3 appear to have a relatively mild phenotype and are the only two individuals in the current cohort who do not carry the p.R401X mutation. Aside from these broad considerations, more detailed genotype-phenotype correlations will be possible only with the detection of further patients.
