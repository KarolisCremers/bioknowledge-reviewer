# BioKnowledge reviewer library
This is a Python library to create structured reviews integrating knowledge and data from different types. We built a library for a dynamic, interactive and evolving network construction and hypothesis generation process. It is designed to build the review network based on the research question hypothesis. In Figure workflow we show the workflow of network-based review and hypothesis generation process.
